Dynamic Multi-Select in React
=============================

A multi-select component controlled via query string and dynamically fetched. API not included.

Built with React/Flux, Bootstrap, Node.js, and Gulp.

## Quick start

Clone this repo.

Make sure [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/) are
[installed](http://nodejs.org/download/).

```sh
npm install
npm install -g gulp
gulp
```

Once that's done, open up http://localhost:3000/ in your browser.

## Special Thanks

This component uses the [react-tree-menu](https://github.com/MandarinConLaBarba/react-tree-menu)
component. It is included inline because at the time of creating this widget react-tree-menu was
in a non-compiling state so I had to modify it to fit my needs.
